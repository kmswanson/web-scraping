# Web Scraping Homework: Mission to Mars

This homework assignment was to scrape information from a website, put into a dataframe, and use that dataframe to pull the relevant information to be able to properly answer the questions.

The first half of the assignment involved scraping both titles and text from the Mars news articles. This information was saved into an empty list (news_list[]) so that the relevant information could later be appended. The final step was to display the text.

The second half of the assignment involved scraping data and using it to create a dataframe that would later be used to display information in graphs. The datatypes also needed to be changed, so once that was done the data was ready to be analyzed. Step 5 in the homework instructions asked questions that would use the data to answer them, so the key was simply to pull the correct information and perform whatever was being asked by the instructions.

Overall, this was a pretty straightforward homework assignment, and was actually rather enjoyable.

Referenced material consisted of the cloud recordings of previous class periods, as well as supplemental content provided by the instructor.
